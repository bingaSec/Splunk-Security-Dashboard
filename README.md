# SIEM Security Dashboard Development

## Project Overview
Developed a custom Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboard using **Splunk Enterprise**. This project focuses on monitoring organizational security policy compliance and detecting real-time threats using the BOTSv3 (Boss of the SOC) dataset.

## Tools & Technologies
* **Splunk Enterprise:** SIEM platform for data ingestion and visualization.
* **SPL (Search Processing Language):** For complex security data querying.
* **BOTSv3 Dataset:** Real-world security dataset for SOC simulation.

## Monitoring Capabilities
* **MFA Compliance:** Detection of logins bypassing Multi-Factor Authentication.
* **Geographic Anomalies:** Visualization of login attempts from unauthorized countries.
* **Privileged Access:** Real-time monitoring of `sudo` commands and account escalations.
* **Change Management:** Tracking unauthorized software installations and file modifications.

## Featured Evidence
* **Splunk Dashboard:** High-level visualizations for security operations.
